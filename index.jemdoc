== About me
Panagiotis (Panos) Patrinos is currently assistant professor at the [https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/english Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT)] of [https://kuleuven.be/ KU Leuven], Belgium. During fall\/winter 2014 he held a visiting assistant professor position in the department of electrical engineering at Stanford University. He received his Ph.D. in Control and Optimization, M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and M.Eng., all from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), in 2010, 2005 and 2003, respectively. During his studies at the NTUA he received numerous awards, scholarships and grants by the Technical Chamber of Greece, the National Scholarship Foundation, the Eugenides Foundation, the Thomaideio foundation and the General Secretariat of Research and Technology. After his PhD he held postdoctoral positions at the University of Trento and IMT School of Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy, where he became an assistant professor in 2012. He co-organized the Workshop on Embedded Optimization (EMBOPT 2014) and the European Conference on Computational Optimization (EUCCO 2016).  He has given invited talks at Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA, EPFL, KTH, Lund and Freiburg among other universities. He is the author of more than 40 papers in prestigious journals and conference proceedings.His current research interests are focused on optimization theory, in particular operator splitting techniques for convex and nonconvex optimization. Specifically, he is working on novel, efficient algorithms and software ([https://github.com/kul-forbes/ForBES ForBES]) for large-scale, distributed and embedded real-time optimization with applications ranging from model predictive control of dynamical systems (robotics, automotive, aerospace) to high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and data mining. He is also interested in stochastic and risk-averse dynamic optimization with applications in the energy and power systems domain.
